    When you hear designers refer to a Design System, they're referring to the design language
    & visual components.

    When you hear developers refer to a Design System they're referring to the component
    library.

    A Design System is both of these wrapped in a style guide ðŸ’»

    The longer I do this, the more convinced I am that global design tokens and component
    design tokens are hugely different problems and the fact that everyone is treating them the
    same is why much of current solutions are brittle and rely almost entirely on convention.
    <br />
    <br /> Global tokens are to align on primitive values (colors, type, etc) and it's an
    important but somewhat smaller problem. They're one value (primary-color).
    <br />
    <br /> Component tokens are part of a platform-agnostic representation of how a component
    should look. They can't exist singularly. Fwiw I am actually thinking about this as
    separate from theming as well. Much of these tokens aren't necessarily designed to be
    customized by an end user.
